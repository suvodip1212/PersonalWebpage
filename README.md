## Project Overview

Welcome to the Instagram Website Clone project! This project showcases my web development skills by creating a replica of the popular social media platform, Instagram. By utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've recreated the user interface and some of the key features of Instagram's website. Please note that this project is purely for educational and portfolio purposes and is not affiliated with Instagram.

Explore the world of social media through this clone's interface and get a glimpse of how Instagram's design and functionality work together.
